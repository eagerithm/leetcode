# 1108. Defanging an IP Address

Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

```
- Example 1:
Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"

- Example 2:
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
```

### Constraints:

The given address is a valid IPv4 address.

```js
/**
 * @param {string} address
 * @return {string}
 */

const address1 = "1.1.1.1";
const address2 = "255.100.50.0";

var defangIPaddr = function (address) {};
```
