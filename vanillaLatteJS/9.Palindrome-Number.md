# Q

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

Example 1:

```js
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 4:

Input: x = -101
Output: false
```

Constraints:

```js
-231 <= x <= 231 - 1;
```

# A

```js
/**
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPalindrome = function (x) {
  const absNum = Math.abs(x);
  const reversedNumStr = +[...(absNum + "")].reverse().join("");
  return x < 0 ? false : absNum === reversedNumStr;
};
```
