# Q

We are given two strings, s and goal.

A shift on s consists of taking string s and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if s = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea' after one shift on s. Return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

```
Example 1:
Input: s = 'abcde', goal = 'cdeab'
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = 'abcde', goal = 'abced'
Output: false
Note:
```

s and goal will have length at most 100.

# A

```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} goal
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var rotateString = function (s, goal) {
  return (s + s).includes(goal) && s.length === goal.length;
};
```
